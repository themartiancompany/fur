Synopsis
========

fur *[options]* *[packages]*

Description
===========

The fur, acronym for "Fallback User Repository",
is an helper program for the uncensorable, unstoppable
Ur user repository and application store which
retrieves and installs binary packages from
censorable sources, like Github.

Of course the name 'fur' carries other meanings
as well, given the Ur is the DogeOS application store.

I suppose nobody should explain how a fur relates
to a Doge, no?

Repo structure
===============

Each branch on a repository represents a software
package. Packages are currently provided for the desktop
and mobile Life and DogeOS bases.

If you want a binary package for a new software to
be added to this specific instance of the fur,
feel free to open a request in the issues section.
