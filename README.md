# Fur

The fur, acronym for "Fallback
[User Repository](
  ../ur)",
is an helper program for the Ur uncensorable,
unstoppable user repository and application store which
retrieves and installs binary packages from
censorable sources, like Github.

Of course the name 'fur' carries other meanings
as well, given the Ur is the DogeOS application store.

I suppose nobody should explain how a fur relates
to a Doge, no?

## Installation

To install and run the program using the ur just run

```bash
ur \
  fur    
```

to install it with make instead run

```bash
make \
  install
```

You can also just run the program using bash,
so if you cloned it in your home directory run

```bash
bash \
  ~/fur/fur/fur
```

add the `-h` option to return the help.
